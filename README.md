# SkyScape
Source scripts for the Skyrim mod "SkyScape"

To read these scripts cleanly, you need to download the custom papyrus language definition I made to use with my mods. 
It is a work in progress and can be downloaded from the link below:

This can only be used in Notepad++, and I recommend monokai as the theme to use. 
I apologize for any inconveniences this may cause.
