# SkyScape
Runescape in Skyrim

This mod is an attempt to fully recreate Runescape in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. This mod recreates the skills, quests, and the overall feel of Runescape, as a first person experience using the creation engine. The aim of the project is to recreate the best parts of all the different Runescape products, not just RS3, OSRS, Deadman, and Darkscape(rip). 

The source scripts used in the mod (for the time being) are to be made publicly known. This may change if the mod gets put online, to avoid code abuse.

To read these scripts cleanly, you need to download the custom papyrus language definition I made to use with my mods. 
It is a work in progress and can be downloaded from the link below:

This can only be used in Notepad++, and I recommend monokai as the theme to use. 
I apologize for any inconveniences this may cause.
